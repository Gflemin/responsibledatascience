The Python code for the book is exclusively for the facial recognition
example in Chapter 8. Unfortunately, the code and data for this chapter is 
large in size and does not fit into the code repository itself. To download and
run it yourself, you should do the following:

1. Navigate to the folder at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13OpxSM3B1ff5AHkRbcHsR4Ys3_44OCuA?usp=sharing and
download both files
2. Upload the code_and_data.zip file to the home directory of your personal Google Drive _without_ unzipping the .zip
file.
3. Navigate to https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/ and click "Upload" to upload the 
ch8_fairness_in_computer_vision.ipynb file in Google Colab.
4. Run the first code chunk (from google.colab import drive...) and input the authentication code.

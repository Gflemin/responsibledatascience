The Python code for the book is exclusively for the facial recognition
example in Chapter 8. Unfortunately, the code and data for this chapter is 
large in size (>600 MB) and does not fit into the code repository itself. To download and
run it yourself, you should do the following:

1. Navigate to https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Responsible+Data+Science-p-9781119741640 and download the file labeled "Code and Data for Chapter 8" in the "Downloads" section of the page.
2. Unzip the Code_and_Data_for_Chapter_8.zip file to a folder on your local computer. 
3. Upload the code_and_data.zip folder within your new Code_and_Date_for_Chapter_8 folder to the "My Drive" folder of your Google Drive account _without_ unzipping it.
4. Navigate to https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/ and click "Upload" to upload the 
ch8_fairness_in_computer_vision.ipynb file from your computer into Google Colab.
5. Run the first code chunk (from google.colab import drive...) and input the authentication code.
6. Run the remaining code within the script.
